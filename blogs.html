            Have you ever looked up and wondered how the sky changes colors throughout the day? From soft pinks and
            oranges during sunrise to deep blues and purples at night — it’s a canvas that never repeats itself.
        </p>

            The sky teaches us the beauty of change. Clouds form and disappear, stars blink into view, and sometimes, if
            you're lucky, a rainbow stretches across the horizon.
        </p>

        <p>
            Observing the sky can bring peace and presence. Try lying down under an open sky and just... breathe. Notice
            the clouds, the light, the silence.
        </p>

        <p>
            This world is full of wonders, and the sky is one of the most magical. Let's protect our Earth so the skies
            remain beautiful for generations to come.
